		<h1>Dining Room</h1>
		<p>You have just stepped in to the most opulent and decadent dining room in New York City. Every table has a party of A-list celebrity diners that are here to see and to be seen; each hoping to be annointed with a personal table-side visit from Chef Gordon Ramsay. The maitre'd has just summoned you over to check on a customer's order. What are you going to do?</p>

		<h1>Kitchen</h1>
		<p>Chef Ramsey's kitchen is the apex of culinary excellence and orderly chaos. The kitchen is a buzzing bee hive of activity as Chef Ramsey's kitchen staff diligently prepare each customer's dish precisely to order. There is a relentless driving rhythm to the pace of their work. The kitchen is hot as Hell as each member of the staff toils amongst the leaping flames. What are you here for?</p>

		<h1>Chef Ramsay's Office</h1>
		<p>Chef Ramsey's office is spartan and sparkling clean. A faint odor of brimstone wafts through the air. Hanging from the wall behind Chef Ramsey is a well-worn cricket bat that has been wielded upon many an unfortunate sous chef. Will you be next? Beads of sweat drip from your brow as Chef Ramsay glares up at you from his desk.</p>
